# VFP9-Taskpane

Taskpane classes and sample for Visual FoxPro 9. Mimics the task pane behavior of older windows control panel. 

One of many small projects that I originally created (in 2006) for Visual FoxPro.

Includes the following packaged classes:

* taskpanemanager
* taskpane
* taskpanepanel

To run the taskpane example demo projects:

* Open `taskpane examples.pjx` in Visual FoxPro 9
* In the Project Manager, navigate to the `Documents` tab and expand `Forms`.
* Select `taskpane_example1` or `taskpane_example2` form and double click or click the `Run` button to preview the example.
